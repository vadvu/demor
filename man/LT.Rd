\usage{
LT(age, sex = "m", mx, ax = NULL, w = NULL, l0 = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{age}{Numeric array of age intervals; for full life table = \code{0:100}; for concise life table = \code{c(0:1, seq(5,85,5))}}

\item{sex}{Character. Sex. \code{"m"} for males or \code{"f"} for females. By default = \code{"m"}.}

\item{mx}{Numeric array with age specific mortality rates.}

\item{ax}{Optional. Numeric array with ax. By default, it is the middle of the interval, while ax for age 0 is modeled as in Andreev & Kingkade (2015).}

\item{w}{Optional. Numeric array with weights for each age interval for calculating weighted life expectancy (\code{wex}).}

\item{l0}{Numeric. Life table radix. By default, = \code{1} but it can be any positive real number. In "human" demography tradition it is 100'000, in "ecological" and "evolutionary" demography tradition it is 1.}
}
\value{
Matrix of (age x 9). Columns are: age, mx, ax, qx, lx, dx, Lx, Tx, ex

\description{
Life table
}
\details{
By default, ax for age 0 is modeled as in Andreev & Kingkade (2015, p. 390, see table 3-2).
