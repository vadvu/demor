#' @details
#' This indicator is calculated as follows
#' \deqn{TFR_{i,t}' = \frac{TFR_{i,t}}{1-(M_{i,t+1} - M_{i,t-1}) / 2}}
#' where \eqn{TFR_{i,t}', TFR_{i,t}} are tempo-adjusted and usual total fertility rate for parity \eqn{i} and time \eqn{t} respectively, \eqn{M_{i,t}} is mean age at childbearing for parity \eqn{i} and time \eqn{t}. The tempo-adjusted total fertility rate is a sum of parity-specific \eqn{TFR_i'}.
#'
#' Note, the calculation are done as in footnote 1 in (Bongaarts & Feeney, 2000, p. 563). Unfortunately, the original 1998 article does not provide the exact formula, which has caused some confusion in academic circles.
